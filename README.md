it is a form that you fill and once you save the data, you are directed to a more brief version of the form you just filled in. it looks like a bank card and provides a quick glance at your profile (name, current job title and skills).

Tapping on the "bank card" will show its verso, where I thank the authors whose resources I used for this project (images). There are buttons that will take you to their online accounts.

other features :

there is an alert if you do not fill the form completely OR if you try to enter an invalid skill
there is a reset button to empty all fields in the forms.
